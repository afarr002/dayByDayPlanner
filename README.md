# dayByDayPlanner

## Description

The motivation for this project was to create a day planner in which a user could record events throughtout the work day. The user is displayed the current date upon page load, as well as timeblocks for standard business hours. The user has the ability to record, save, and modify events to the timeblocks. The timeblocks are color coded to indicate whether they are in the past, present, or future (blue for past, grey for present, orange for future.). The user's events are stored in local storage, and persist through a page refresh until a user removes the item from the list.

## Tech Used

This page was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Icebox

I will be adding more timeslots in future developments.
